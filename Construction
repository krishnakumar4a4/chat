GEN_TCP:

gen_tcp:listen(Port, Options) -> {ok, ListenSocket} | {error, Reason}
  Sets up a socket to listen on the port Port on the local host.
accept(ListenSocket) -> {ok, Socket} | {error, Reason}
accept(ListenSocket, Timeout) -> {ok, Socket} | {error, Reason}
  Accepts an incoming connection request on a listen socket. Socket must be a socket returned from listen/2. Timeout specifies a timeout value in ms, defaults to infinity.
send(Socket, Packet) -> ok | {error, Reason}
  Sends a packet on a socket.
recv(Socket, Length) -> {ok, Packet} | {error, Reason}
recv(Socket, Length, Timeout) -> {ok, Packet} | {error, Reason}
  This function receives a packet from a socket in passive mode. A closed socket is indicated by a return value {error, closed}.
controlling_process(Socket, Pid) -> ok | {error, Reason}
  Assigns a new controlling process Pid to Socket. The controlling process is the process which receives messages from the socket. If called by any other process than the current controlling process, {error, not_owner} is returned.
close(Socket) -> ok
  Closes a TCP socket.
shutdown(Socket, How) -> ok | {error, Reason}
  Close a socket in one or two directions.

ERL:
erl
  The erl program starts an Erlang runtime system.
  -boot File  Specifies the name of the boot file, File.boot, which is used to start the system. See init(3). Unless File contains an absolute path, the system searches for File.boot in the current and $ROOT/bin directories.
  -config Config Specifies the name of a configuration file, Config.config, which is used to configure applications
  -detached Starts the Erlang runtime system detached from the system console. Useful for running daemons and backgrounds processes. Implies -noinput.

Connect nodes to communicate
  start the each of the erl nodes with a name(one with krishna and other with kumar)
  >erl -sname krishna  and erl -sname kumar
  We can find the node name of each with following command
  >node().
  Try connecting the other with the following command, we should get the respinse as pong,if connected
  >net_adm:ping('kumar@hostname').
  check on both sides with 
  >nodes().
  Now if we start a server globally on one node, it will be available on the other node. Check it using
  >global:registered_names().
  If we want to register your own PID globally. Should return yes.
  >global:register_name(name_atom,self()).
